# Petrovitch The Game
This is a simple maze-like horror game that I built with my classmates at Coll√®ge Fran√ßais during high school.
This project was one of my first experiences in game development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
- Unity Engine
- C#

## The Objective of the Player
The objective is to find your way out of the dark maze before your torch runs out. However, torches are scattered around the maze that you can pick up to replenish your torches flame. To escape, you must activate two levers on the map to open the gate, then return to the start. The game is designed to simulate the fear of darkness, with features that trick you into wasting time.

## Controls
- WASD to move
- Left Click to Interact (the game will not tell you if the object is interactable or not)
- Left Shift to run

## üôè Credits
This game was developed as a high school project at **Coll√®ge Fran√ßais** within the **Concentration de Conception de jeux vid√©o et de r√©alit√© virtuelle**.

Special thanks to:
- Teacher Mr Alexandre Oligny for guidance
- Classmates Alexander Moreno, Aleksandr Kudashkin, Zachary Filipe, Grabriel Rodriguez for collaboration.
